You can use the validator to execute a transformation as described by a
structure map. To do this, you must provide some additional parameters:

 -transform [map]

* [map] the URI of the map that the transform starts with

Any other dependency maps have to be loaded through an -ig reference 

-transform uses the parameters -defn, -txserver, -ig (at least one with the map
files), and -output
