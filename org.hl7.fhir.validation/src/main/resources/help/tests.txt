The validator can be run in test mode, which executes all JUnit tests for the
FHIR core library against a set of test cases in a local directory. To do this,
you must provide a specific parameter with a directory value:

 -test [directory]

The directory must follow the same conventions as the reference test cases found
at https://github.com/FHIR/fhir-test-cases. This mode must also be executed with
the Java property java.locale.providers set to COMPAT as below:

  java -Djava.locale.providers=COMPAT -jar validator_cli.jar -tests
  ./my/path/to/fhir-test-cases

This parameter is compatible with -txCache, -test-modules, and
-test-classname-filter parameters.

The following test-specific parameters can be used to limit which tests are run:
-test-modules [module-names] A comma delimited list of Java module names for
    which to run JUnit tests. By default, all modules are used to run tests.
    Example: -test-modules org.hl7.fhir.dstu2,org.hl7.fhir.dstu2016may

-test-classname-filter [regex] A regex filter applied to test Java class names
    for selecting which JUnit tests to run. By default, all tests are run.
    Example: -test-classname-filter .*ShexGeneratorTests
