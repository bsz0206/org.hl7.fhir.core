The validator can convert between versions of FHIR (r2, r3, and r4). To use the validator to convert versions, provide the following parameters:

 java -jar validator_cli.jar c:\temp\observation.xml -version 3.0 -to-version 4.0 -output c:\temp\observation4.json
The key parameter is "-to-version" which causes the validator to invoke the version conversion routine. 

Technical notes: 

the validator can use either it's own internal routines, or the structure maps found at https://github.com/FHIR/packages/tree/master/interversion.
By default, the internal routines will be used for resources with a canonical URL (e.g. code system etc) and the structure maps will be used otherwise
If the internal routines fail, the structure maps will be used anyway 
you can use the parameter -do-native to get the validator to try the internal routines first for any resource, and the parameter -no-native to tell it not to try them at all
Issues with the structure maps should be discussed on the chat.fhir.org implementers channel, or submitted as PRs against the github repo above
